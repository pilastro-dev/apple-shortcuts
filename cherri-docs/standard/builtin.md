## Built-in Actions

Built-ins in Cherri are actions in the compiler that use standard actions but implement them in a way that makes it easier to use a specific Shortcuts feature.

For example, the [makeVCard()](https://cherrilang.org/language/vcards) action is, in actuality, just a text action, but the compiler uses it to insert the vCard format into a text action based on your input.

## Contains Text

Checks if `text` occurs in `subject`.

```
containsText(text subject, text text, bool ?caseSensitive = true)
```

This uses a [Match Text](https://cherrilang.org/language/standard/documents#match-text) action to check if `text` is within `subject`.

## Base64 Encode File

```
embedFile(text filePath)
```

This built-in action loads the file at `filePath` and encodes it to base 64 at compile time. This will result in a **Text** action containing the base64-encoded contents of the file, which Shortcuts can decode to display an image, play audio, etc.

For example, you could enter a file path for an audio file and use **Play Audio** to play the audio when the Shortcut runs.

Keep in mind you will likely need to decode the contents to use them.

```
const audioFile = embedFile("music/playme.mp3")
const audio = base64Decode(audioFile)
playSound(audio)
```

## Make vCard

Create vCards without having to remember the format. Embed local images as an image for a menu item.

## Raw Action

Create actions by inputting full identifiers and parameters to use actions not supported by Cherri.
